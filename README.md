## Pollux
### Quick Installation

Build code with [Greybel VS](https://github.com/ayecue/greybel-vs) and execute the installer it outputs. From there build the "Pollux.src" file it creates and run the output.
### Installation without Visual Studio Code

Copy all code files ingame to `/pollux/[...]` and change all `import_code` tags in `Pollux.src` to use the absolute path `/pollux/[...]` (for example `import_code(/pollux/commands/scan.src)`)
